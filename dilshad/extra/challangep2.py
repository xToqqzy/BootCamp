# This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.

# Here are the same example lists again:

# 3   4
# 4   3
# 2   5
# 1   3
# 3   9
# 3   3
# For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

# The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
# The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
# The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
# The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
# The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
# The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.
# So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).

# Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?
